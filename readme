TouchRepo README

What is it?
TouchRepo is a lightweight tool for Linux that lets you browse, view, and download files from any GitHub repository without cloning it. It keeps your disk clean and saves time.

How to Install Zenity
TouchRepo needs Zenity and Curl to run. Use the command for your Linux version below:

Ubuntu, Debian, or Mint:
sudo apt update && sudo apt install zenity curl -y

Fedora:
sudo dnf install zenity curl

Arch Linux:
sudo pacman -S zenity curl

openSUSE:
sudo zypper install zenity curl

How to use TouchRepo

   1.Download the script or clone the repo.

   2.Open your terminal in the folder.

   3. Make the script executable: chmod +x touchrepo.sh

  4. Run it: ./touchrepo.sh

How it works

    Add: Paste a GitHub link or a username/repo name. It cleans the link automatically.

    Browse: Select a repo from your saved list in repos.txt.

    View: Read the code of any file directly in a popup window.

    Download: Save only the file you actually need to your computer.

Pro Hack
To run it by just typing touchrepo from anywhere, run this command:
sudo cp touchrepo.sh /usr/local/bin/touchrepo && sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/touchrepo
