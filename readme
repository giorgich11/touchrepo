TouchRepo README

What is it?
TouchRepo is a professional, pre-compiled tool for Linux that lets you browse, view, and download files from any GitHub repository without cloning. It is delivered as a binary file (.bin) for maximum speed and zero setup.

How to Install Zenity
TouchRepo needs Zenity to show you the windows. Run the command for your Linux version:

Ubuntu, Debian, or Mint:
sudo apt update && sudo apt install zenity curl -y

Fedora:
sudo dnf install zenity curl

Arch Linux:
sudo pacman -S zenity curl

How to use TouchRepo

    Download the touchrepo.bin file.

    Open your terminal in that folder.

    Give it permission to run: chmod +x touchrepo.bin

    Start the app: ./touchrepo.bin

How it works

    Add: Paste a GitHub link. The tool handles the rest.

    Vault: Your repos are saved in repos.txt automatically.

    Browse: Open any repo and see the files inside instantly.

    Download: Pick a file and save it to your PC without cloning the whole repo.

Pro Hack
Move the binary to your system path to use it like a real Linux command:
sudo cp touchrepo.bin /usr/local/bin/touchrepo && sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/touchrepo
